# TODO

* authenticate
* get workflows
* get all runs. how to get them in a paced way. lets say via a GitHub action
  cron that runs twice a day and commits to this repo. Are there query params
  that allow me to filter by time in such a specific way? So that I do not miss
  any runs.
* autoformat code
