# TODO

- create a small CLI out of it so I can easily get all runs for other workflows
- reuse the OctoKit instance as I assume that has some state to make sure I
  keep below the ratelimit
- extract DHIS2 related code/data and make repo generic
- setup ELK stack
- ingest data
- create first visualization for for example how did the "Run integration tests" step evolve over time?
